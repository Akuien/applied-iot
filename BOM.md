You will get **20 % of your order** from Pycom with the code provided by mail when you registered to the course.

##What you also need is:

* Micro USB cable (*high quality, you probably already have some lying around*)
- Sensors of your choice. I recommend a [starting kit ](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-aufger%C3%BCsteter-Sensormodul-Bausatz-Anleitung/dp/B01M30ZWQR/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=sensor+kit+arduino&qid=1583957059&sr=8-5)for ~30 EUR.

- [Breadboard(s)](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-Breadboard-Solderless-Distribution-Verbindungsbl%C3%B6cke/dp/B01MCRZFE5/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3L86WOJGVV8CB&keywords=breadboard&qid=1583957299&sprefix=breadboard%2Caps%2C282&sr=8-3).


## Optional, but not needed.






## Choice of LTE and NB-IoT

If you want LTE as well, the FiPy4 is the way to go (in that case, replace LoPy4 with FiPy). It's a bit more expensive, but does the same thing as LoPy4 with added benefit of LTE/NB IoT as well.
