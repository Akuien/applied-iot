- LoPy4 (With headers), https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/
- Expansion board 3.0, https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/
- LoRa/SigFox antenna, https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/



What you also need is:

- Micro USB cable (likely any would do)
- 




If you want LTE as well, the FiPy4 is the way to go (in that case, replace LoPy4 with FiPy). It's a bit more expensive, but does the same thing as LoPy4 with added benefit of LTE/NB IoT as well.
